TODO

- Add: Remove collection items after export
- Add: Settings: Export Collection ID (Example: csv export already offers this feature without setting, yet sylk export is not consistent)
- Add: Settings: Export Collection Created Date
- Add: Export to 'vcf' format
- Add: Settings: Enable / disable warning/notice code which allows for export of less than perfect data (re: allow old code which throws errors to be re-added to the base parser class with settings switch) on above setting)
- Add: Detection of corrupted items and possibly fail when class attributes don't match (per record, per first and last record), possibly depending on above setting)
- Rename: Extension name and related cases of 'collectexport' to 'cie'
